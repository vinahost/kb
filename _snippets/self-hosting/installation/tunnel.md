/// danger
Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To be able to use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n has a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) which redirects requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.
