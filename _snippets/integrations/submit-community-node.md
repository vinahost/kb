/// note | Subject to change
The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.
///
Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

* View the [starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link} and [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes){:target=_blank .external-link} for some examples.
* Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/).
* Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

## Standards

To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:

* Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
* Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
* Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute. Refer to the [package.json in the starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/package.json){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example.
* Check your node using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) and test it locally to ensure it works.
* Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
