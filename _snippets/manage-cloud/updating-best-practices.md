* Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
* Check the [Release notes](/release-notes/) for breaking changes.
* Use [Environments](/source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.
