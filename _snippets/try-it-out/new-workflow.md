When you open n8n, you'll see either:

* An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
* The **Workflows** list on the <span class="inline-image">![Home icon](/_images/common-icons/home.png){.off-glb}</span> **Home** page. Select **Add workflow** to create a new workflow.
